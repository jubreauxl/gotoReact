# gotoReact
After using AngularJs in a ES6+webpack+Babel shell, I decided to dive into react.
This is my very 1st experience with React, that comes just after completing the [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

My favorite reading was: [How to use Webpack with React: an in-depth tutorial](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-webpack-for-react-a36d4cac5060)

Here is a more complete [description](./description.md)
